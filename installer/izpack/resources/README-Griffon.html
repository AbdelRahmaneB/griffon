<h3>Welcome to Griffon!</h3>
This will install and setup <b>Griffon</b> [<a href="http://griffon-framework.org">http://griffon-framework.org</a>].
<p>Griffon is an application framework for developing desktop applications in the JVM, with Groovy being the primary
    language of choice. Inspired by Grails, Griffon follows the Convention over Configuration paradigm, paired with an
    intuitive MVC architecture and a command line interface. Griffon also follows the spirit of the Swing Application
    Framework (JSR 296), it defines a simple yet powerful application life cycle and event publishing mechanism. Another
    interesting feature comes from the Groovy language itself: automatic property support and property binding (inspired
    by BeansBinding (JSR 295)), which makes creating observable beans and binding to their properties a snap! As if
    property binding was not enough Groovy's SwingBuilder also simplifies building multi-threaded applications, say
    goodbye to the ugly gray rectangle (the bane of Swing apps)!</p>

<p>Grails developers should feel right at home when trying out Griffon. Many of Grails' conventions and commands are
    shared with Griffon. Granted, Swing is not the same as HTML/GSP but Builders simplify the task of creating the
    UI.</p>

<p>Seasoned Java developers will also be able to pick up the pace quickly, as the framework relieves you of the burden
    of maintaining an application structure, allowing you to concentrate on getting the code right.</p>
