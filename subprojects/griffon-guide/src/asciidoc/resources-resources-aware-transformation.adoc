= The @ResourcesAware AST Transformation

Any component may gain the ability to locate resources through a +ResourceHandler+
instance. You only need annotate the class with
+link:api/griffon/transform/ResourcesAware.html[griffon.transform.ResourcesAware]+
and it will automatically gain all methods exposed by
+link:api/griffon/core/resources/ResourceHandler.html[ResourceHandler]+.

This feature is just a shortcut to avoid reaching for the application instance
from objects that do not hold a reference to it.

Here's an example of a custom bean that's able to locate resources

[source,groovy]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
@griffon.transform.ResourcesAware
class Bean {
    String name
}
----

This class can be used in the following way

[source,groovy]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
class SampleService {
    @Inject Bean bean

    InputStream fetchResource(String arg) {
        bean.name = arg
        bean.getResourceAsStream(bean.name)
    }
}
----
