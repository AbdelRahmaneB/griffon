== Creating a Project

The first task at hand is deciding which build tool to use. Both Gradle and Maven are popular choices.
The Griffon team recommends using Gradle as it delivers a much better experience than Maven or even Ant+Ivy.
The following sections show sample build files for Gradle, Maven and Ant with Groovy as the target language. You may
use Java instead if you want of course, however Groovy is more expressive with less clutter, thus lending itself
for a better learning experience. But don't worry if you're nor familiar with Groovy, this guide includes further
examples where Java is the main language.

=== Gradle

The following listing shows a typical Gradle build file for a Griffon project

[[gradle-build-file]]
.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
include::{console-swing-groovy}/build.gradle.txt[]
----
<1> Project properties
<2> Apply +groovy+ plugin for compiling Groovy sources
<3> Apply +application+ plugin for running and packaging
<4> APT will run automatically
<5> Standard Griffon project layout
<6> Needed for compile-time generation of metadata
<7> Groovy specific support for Griffon
<8> Toolkit specific support
<9> Groovy SwingBuilder
<10> An implementation of JSR 330 is required
<11> Logging framework
<12> Log4j to Slf4j connector
<13> Test dependencies

=== Maven

Maven is another popular choice among developers. The following listing displays the minimal setup that's
required to build a Griffon application with Maven.

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
include::{console-swing-groovy}/pom.xml.txt[]
----
<1> Project properties
<2> Apply +groovy+ plugin for compiling Groovy sources
<3> Apply +application+ plugin for running and packaging
<4> APT required for compile-time generation of metadata
<5> Standard Griffon project layout
<6> Needed for compile-time generation of metadata
<7> Groovy specific support for Griffon
<8> Toolkit specific support
<9> Groovy SwingBuilder
<10> An implementation of JSR 330 is required
<11> Logging framework
<12> Log4j to Slf4j connector
<13> Test dependencies

Notice the similarities with the <<gradle-build-file,gradle>> build file as marked with each one
of the 12 callouts.

=== Ant

Ant build files are simple in nature however their complexity max grow exponentially as more
behavior is needed. The following shows a very basic Ant build file that assumes all dependencies
are located relative to the project

.build.xml
[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
include::{console-swing-groovy}/build.xml.txt[]
----
<1> Project properties
<2> Classpath definitions
<3> Load +groovy+ task for compiling Groovy sources
<4> Standard Griffon project layout
<5> Run the application
<6> Compile tests
<7> Run tests and generate report

These are the dependencies as required by this project:

.build
include::{projectdir}/build/generated-dependencies/build.adoc[]

.provided
include::{projectdir}/build/generated-dependencies/provided.adoc[]

.compile
include::{projectdir}/build/generated-dependencies/compile.adoc[]

.runtime
include::{projectdir}/build/generated-dependencies/runtime.adoc[]

.test
include::{projectdir}/build/generated-dependencies/test.adoc[]

It's assumed that JUnit is properly configured in your Ant distribution.

TODO: insert section on Lazybones templates

== Project Layout

Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the standard Griffon project layout. Every Griffon
project shares the same layout, making it easy to dive in as artifacts are located in specific
directories according to their responsibilities and behavior.

To give you an idea of what we're aiming at with this example here's an screenshot
of the finished application running. A small Groovy script has been executed, you
can see the result on the bottom right side

=== Model

The model for this application is simple: it contains properties that hold the script to be
evaluated and the results of the evaluation. Make sure you paste the following code into
+griffon-app/models/console/ConsoleModel.groovy+.

.griffon-app/models/console/ConsoleModel.groovy
[source,groovy]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
include::{console-swing-groovy}/griffon-app/models/console/ConsoleModel.groovy[]
----
<1> Holds the script's text
<2> Holds the result of the script's execution
<3> Enable/disable flag

Griffon Models are *_not_* domain classes like the ones you find in Grails; they're more akin
to presentation models, and as such, they're used to transfer data between Views and Controllers.

=== Controller

The controller is also trivial: throw the contents of the script from the model at an +Evaluator+,
then store the result back into the model. Make sure you paste the following code into
+griffon-app/controllers/console/ConsoleController.groovy+.

.griffon-app/controllers/console/ConsoleController.groovy
[source,groovy]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
include::{console-swing-groovy}/griffon-app/controllers/console/ConsoleController.groovy[]
----
<1> MVC member injected by +link:api/griffon/core/mvc/MVCGroupManager.html[MVCGroupManager]+
<2> Injected by JSR 330
<3> Controller action; automatically executed off the UI thread
<4> Evaluate the script
<5> Write back result to Model

The Griffon framework will inject references to the other portions of the MVC triad if fields
named +model+, +view+, and +controller+ are present in the Model, Controller or View. This allows
us to access the view widgets and the model data if needed. Any other class members annotated with
+@Inject+ participate in dependency injection as laid out by JSR 330, in this case the controller
will get an instance of +Evaluator+ if a suitable implementation is bound.

The +executeScript+ [conum,data-value=3]_3_ method will be used later in the View in combination
with a button. You may notice that there's no explicit threading management. All Swing developers
know they must obey the Swing Rule: long running computations must run outside of the EDT; all UI
components should be queried/modified inside the EDT. It turns out Griffon is aware of this rule,
making sure an action is called outside of the EDT by default, all bindings made to UI components
via the model will be updated inside the EDT [conum,data-value=5]_5_. We'll setup the bindings in
the next listing.

We must create a +link:api/griffon/core/injection/Module.html[Module]+ in order to bind +Evaluator+.
These are the required class definitions

.src/main/groovy/console/Evaluator.groovy
[source,groovy]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
include::{console-swing-groovy}/src/main/groovy/console/Evaluator.groovy[]
----

.src/main/groovy/console/GroovyShellEvaluator.groovy
[source,groovy]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
include::{console-swing-groovy}/src/main/groovy/console/GroovyShellEvaluator.groovy[]
----

.src/main/groovy/console/ApplicationModule.groovy
[source,groovy]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
include::{console-swing-groovy}/src/main/groovy/console/ApplicationModule.groovy[]
----
<1> Binding definition
<2> Overriding an existing binding
<3> Loaded after 'swing' module

Modules can define several bindings, even override existing bindings. In our particular
case we defined a binding [conum,data-value=1]_1_ for +Evaluator+ and override a
a binding [conum,data-value=2]_2_ for +SwingWindowDisplayHandler+. The latter is
supplied by the +swing+ module thus me must mark it as a dependency [conum,data-value=3]_3_
in our module definition. The implementation of out custom +SwingWindowDisplayHandler+
is quite trivial, as shown by the following snippet

.src/main/groovy/console/CenteringWindowDisplayHandler.groovy
[source,groovy]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
include::{console-swing-groovy}/src/main/groovy/console/CenteringWindowDisplayHandler.groovy[]
----

This handler is only concerned with centering the window on the screen before showing it.

=== View

The view classes contain the visual components for your application. Please paste the following code
into +griffon-app/views/console/ConsoleView.groovy+.

.griffon-app/views/console/ConsoleView.groovy
[source,groovy]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
include::{console-swing-groovy}/griffon-app/views/console/ConsoleView.groovy[]
----
<1> MVC member injected by +link:api/griffon/core/mvc/MVCGroupManager.html[MVCGroupManager]+
<2> Bind enabled state from model
<3> Bind script source to model
<4> Apply controller action by convention
<5> Bind script result from model

The View contains a fairly straightforward SwingBuilder script. Griffon will execute these groovy
scripts in context of it's +link:api/griffon/util/CompositeBuilder.html[CompositeBuilder]+.

== Running the application

Running the application requires you to execute a build tool specific command

.gradle
[source]
----
gradle run
----

.maven
[source]
----
mvn compile exec:java
----

.ant
[source]
----
ant compile run
----

== Testing

.src/test/groovy/console/ConsoleControllerTest.groovy
[source,groovy]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
include::{console-swing-groovy}/src/test/groovy/console/ConsoleControllerTest.groovy[]
----
<1> Indicate class under test
<2> Injected by +GriffonUnitRule+ given [conum,data-value=1]_1_
<3> Injected by +GriffonUnitRule+ via JSR 330
<4> Instantiates and configures a +GriffonAplication+ for testing
<5> Setup collaborators
<6> Stimulus
<7> Validate after waiting 2 seconds at most
<8> Override +Evaluator+ binding

Running tests requires executing a build tool specific command
