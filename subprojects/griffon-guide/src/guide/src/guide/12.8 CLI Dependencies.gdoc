Plugins can provide compile time classes that should not be bundled with runtime classes (i.e, addon sources). Sources and resources placed under @$basedir/src/cli@ will be automatically compiled and packaged into a jar whose name matches @griffon-${plugin.name}-${plugin.version}-compile.jar@. A typical use case for these type of classes is a custom AST transformation that should be run during compile time but not at runtime.
