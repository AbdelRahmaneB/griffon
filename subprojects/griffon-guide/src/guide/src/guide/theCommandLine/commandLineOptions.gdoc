The following command line options only have meaning while building the project. They have no effect when running the application once it has been [packaged|guide:packaging].

It's worth noting that all of the following options can also be specified in either @griffon-app/conf/BuildConfig.groovy@ (local to project) or @$USER_HOME/.griffon/settings.groovy@ (global to all projects), with the caveat that values specified at the command prompt will have precedence over those specified in the config file.
