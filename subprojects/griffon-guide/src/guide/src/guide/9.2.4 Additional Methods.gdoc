There are two additional methods that complement the generic threading facilities that Griffon exposes to the application and its artifacts

* @isUIThread()@ - returns true if the current thread is the UI Thread, false otherwise. Functionally equivalent to calling @SwingUtilities.isEventDispatchThread()@ in Swing.
* @execFuture(ExecutorService s, Closure c)@ - schedules a closure on the target ExecutorService. The executor service can be left unspecified, if so a default Thread pool executor (with 2 threads) will be used.
* @execFuture(ExecutorService s, Callable c)@ - schedules a callable on the target ExecutorService. The executor service can be left unspecified, if so a default Thread pool executor (with 2 threads) will be used.
