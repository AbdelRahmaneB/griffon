Making sure a block of code is executed outside the UIThread is made by invoking the @execOutsideUI{}@ method. This method is equivalent to calling @doOutside{}@ in Swing.

Example:

{code}
class MyController {
    def model

    def action1 = {
        // will be invoked inside the UI Thread by default (pre 0.9.2)
        def value = model.value
        execOutsideUI {
            // do some calculations
            execInsideUIAsync {
                // back inside the UI Thread
                model.result = ...
            }
        }
    }

    def action2 = {
        // will be invoked outside of the UI Thread by default (post 0.9.2)
        def value = model.value
        // do some calculations
        execInsideUIAsync {
            // back inside the UI Thread
            model.result = ...
            execOutsideUI {
                // do more calculations
            }
        }
    }
}
{code}
