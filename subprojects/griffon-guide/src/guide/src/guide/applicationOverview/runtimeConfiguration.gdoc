The application's runtime configuration is available through the @config@ property of the application instance. This is a @ConfigObject@ whose contents are obtained by merging @Application.groovy@ and @Config.groovy@. Builder configuration is available through the @builderConfig@ property and reflects the contents of @Builder.groovy@. Configuration files may also be provided as properties files; settings on the matching script will be overridden by those set in the properties file.
