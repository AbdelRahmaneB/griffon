All applications have the same [life-cycle|guide:applicationLifecycle] phases. You can inspect in which phase the application is currently on by calling the @getPhase()@ method on an application instance. Valid values are defined by the [ApplicationPhase|api:griffon.core.ApplicationPhase] enum : @INITIALIZE@, @STARTUP@, @READY@, @MAIN@ and @SHUTDOWN@.
