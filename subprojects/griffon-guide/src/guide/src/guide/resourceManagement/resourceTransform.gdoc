Any component may gain the ability to resolve messages through the application's ResourceResolver. You only need annotate the class with @[griffon.transform.ResourceResolverAware|api:griffon.transform.ResourceResolverAware]@ and it will automatically gain all methods exposed by @[ResourceResolver|guide:griffon.core.resources.ResourceResolver]@.

This feature is just a shortcut to avoid reaching for the application instance from objects that do not hold a reference to it.
