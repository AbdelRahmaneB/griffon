h4. Service LifeCycle

Services now have their own life-cycle methods, similarly to their MVC counterparts. See the section [Service LifeCycle|guide:serviceLifecycle] for more information.

h4. Service Configuration DSL

Services properties may now be configured externally to the service class, using a simple DSL. Refer to the [Service Configuration DSL|guide:serviceConfiguration] section to learn more.

h4. External Configuration

Applications now have the ability to specify alternate locations for configuration files and scripts. Simply configure @griffon.config.locations@ in @Config.groovy@, for example

{code:java}
griffon.config.locations = [
    "classpath:${appName}-config.properties",
    "classpath:${appName}-config.groovy",
    "file:${userHome}/.griffon/${appName}-config.properties",
    "file:${userHome}/.griffon/${appName}-config.groovy"]
{code}

Section [External Configuration Support|guide:externalConfiguration] covers this feature with more detail.

h4. New Application Events

Instances managed by the application (such as MVC members) will now trigger a @DestroyInstance@ event when the instance is no longer needed. This event is the counterpart of @NewInstance@.

h4. EventRouter Factory

It's now possible to instantiate custom instances of `EventRouter` by defining a custom `EventRouterFactory`.

h4. Externalized Configuration

Some deployments require that configuration be sourced from more than one place and be changeable without requiring a rebuild of the application. In order to support deployment scenarios such as these the configuration can be externalized. To do so, point Griffon at the locations of the configuration files that should be used by adding a @griffon.config.locations@ setting in @Config.groovy@, for example:

{code:java}
griffon.config.locations = [
    "classpath:${appName}-config.properties",
    "classpath:${appName}-config.groovy",
    "file:${userHome}/.griffon/${appName}-config.properties",
    "file:${userHome}/.griffon/${appName}-config.groovy"]
{code}
