h1. factories

h2. Purpose

Provide additional node factories.

h2. Examples

{code}
class SampleGriffonAddon {
    Map factories = \[
        customComponent: new MyCustomComponentFactory()
    \]
}
{code}

h2. Description

The @factories@ property is responsible for adding new node factories to builders. Each node factory is defined by a key (matching the node name) and a Factory instance. However if the value is not a factory but a Class it will then be wrapped with a simple BeanFactory.
