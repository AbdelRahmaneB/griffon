h2. Description

Usage: 
{code:java}
griffon [environment]* test-app [names]*
{code}


Executes the Griffon unit and integration tests located in the @test/unit@ and @test/integration@ directories. By default all tests are executed, but you can specify the names of the tests (without the "Tests" suffix) as argument to the command:

{code:java}
griffon test-app Foo
griffon test-app Foo Bar
{code}

You can also choose to only run the unit or integration tests:

{code:java}
griffon test-app -unit
griffon test-app -integration
{code}

The first example will execute a test called @FooTests.groovy@ whilst the second will execute @FooTests.groovy@ and @BarTests.groovy@ if they exist.

If you only wish to re-run failed tests use the -rerun flag

{code:java}
griffon test-app -rerun
{code}
