== Installation from Download ==

- Prerequisites

In order to start using Griffon you need to have the following:
* An installation of Java SDK 1.5 or higher and have set your JAVA_HOME 
  variable to the SDK install location. Java 1.6 is strongly recommended.

- Steps

* Download [from http://griffon.codehaus.org/Download] the latest Griffon
  release.
* Extract the archive into an appropriate location; typically C:\griffon on
  Windows or ~/griffon on Unix.
* Create a GRIFFON_HOME environment variable that points to the path where you
  extracted the archive (eg C:\griffon on Windows or ~/griffon on Unix).
* If you have not set the JAVA_HOME environment variable yet, create JAVA_HOME
  environment variable that points to the path where you have installed Java.
* Append a reference to the "bin" directory within the Griffon directory to
  your PATH variable (eg %GRIFFON_HOME%\bin on Windows or $GRIFFON_HOME/bin on
  Unix). Note that, for Windows, both PATH and GRIFFON_HOME must be defined at
  the same environment variable level (eg. 'System variables') rather than
  across environment variable levels (eg. PATH under 'System variables' and 
  GRIFFON_HOME under 'User variables').
* Type "griffon" at the command line, if a help message is displayed you are
  ready to start using Griffon [http://griffon.codehaus.org/Quick+Start]
* If you get an error message, try to chmod +x the griffon script inside the
  bin directory.

== Installation from Git ==

- Prerequisites

In order to start using Griffon from Git you need to have the following:
* An installation of Java 1.5 or higher and have set your JAVA_HOME variable
  to the install location.
* A working installation of Apache Ant [http://ant.apache.org] 1.7 or higher
  and have set your ANT_HOME variable to the install location.
* JUnit (to run the build tests - put junit.jar in your ANT_HOME/lib directory)
* An installation of Git [http://git-scm.com/].

- Steps

* Checkout Griffon from the Git repository 
  [http://xircles.codehaus.org/projects/griffon/repo]
** Run this command: git clone git://git.codehaus.org/griffon-git.git
* Set the GRIFFON_HOME environment variable to some location that is not below
  the checkout location.
* Add the $GRIFFON_HOM/bin directory to your PATH environment variable.
* Add the $GRIFFON_HOME/ant/bin directory to your PATH environment variable.
* You may need to give the scripts in $GRIFFON_HOME/ant/bin execute permissions
* Go to the $GRIFFON_HOME directory and type "ant install" to build Griffon and
  install it in your $GRIFFON_HOME directory.
* That's it! Start developing with Griffon!
