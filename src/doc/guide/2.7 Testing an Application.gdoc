The @create-*@ commands in Griffon automatically create integration tests for you within the @test/integration@ directory. It is of course up to you to populate these tests with valid test logic, information on which can be found in the section on [Testing|guide:testing]. However, if you wish to execute tests you can run the [test-app|commandLine] command as follows:

{code}
griffon test-app
{code}

Griffon also automatically generates an Ant @build.xml@ which can also run the tests by delegating to Griffon' [test-app|commandLine] command:

{code}
ant test
{code}

This is useful when you need to build Griffon applications as part of a continuous integration platform such as CruiseControl.
