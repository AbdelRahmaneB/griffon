By default every Griffon application inherits a bunch of framework dependencies. This is done through the line:

{code}
inherits "global"
{code}

Inside the @BuildConfig.groovy@ file. If you wish exclude certain inherited dependencies then you can do so using the @excludes@ method:

{code}
inherits("global") {
    excludes "oscache", "ehcache"
}
{code}
