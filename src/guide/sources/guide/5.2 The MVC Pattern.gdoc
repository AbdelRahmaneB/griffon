All Griffon applications operate with a basic unit called the MVC group. An MVC group is comprised of 3 member parts: [Models|guide:models], [Views|guide:views] and [Controllers|guide:controllers]. However it is possible to add (or even remove) members from an MVC group by carefully choosing a suitable configuration.

MVC groups configuration is setup in @Application.groovy@ located inside @griffon-app/conf@. This file holds an entry for every MVC group that the application has (not counting those provided by [plugins/addons|guide:addons]).
