h4. IntelliJ IDEA

The most mature Groovy & Griffon IDE is [IntelliJ IDEA|http://www.jetbrains.com/idea] and the [JetGroovy|http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/GRVY/Groovy+Home] plug-in. Refer to the section on [Groovy and Griffon|http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/groovy_griffon.html] support on the JetBrains website for a feature overview.

h4. NetBeans 

A good Open Source alternative is Sun's NetBeans, which provides a Groovy/Griffon plugin that automatically recognizes Griffon projects and provides the ability to run Griffon applications in the IDE and code completion. For an overview of features see the [NetBeans Griffon Plugin page|http://plugins.netbeans.org/PluginPortal/faces/PluginDetailPage.jsp?pluginid=18664] written by Geertjan Wielanga.

h4. Eclipse

For "Eclipse":http://www.eclipse.org/ there is also the "Groovy Eclipse Plugin":http://groovy.codehaus.org/Eclipse+Plugin that offers syntax highlighting, code completion and so on.

Griffon automatically creates Eclipse @.project@ and @.classpath@ files for you, so to import a Griffon project just right-click in the "Package Explorer" and select "Import" then "Existing project into Workspace" and "Browse" to the location of your project.

Then immediately click "Ok" followed by "Finish" and your project will be set-up.

Griffon will also automatically set-up an appropriate Eclipse "Run Configuration", that can be accessed from the "Run" menu in Eclipse.

h4. TextMate

Since Griffon' focus is on simplicity it is often possible to utilize more simple editors and "TextMate":http://macromates.com/ on the Mac has an excellent Groovy/Griffon bundle available from the [Texmate bundles SVN|http://wiki.macromates.com/Main/SubversionCheckout].
