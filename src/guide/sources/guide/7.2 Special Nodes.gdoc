The rule of thumb to find out the node name of a Swing class is this:
* drop the first @J@ from the class name
* uncapitalize the next character

Examples
@JButton@ => @button@
@JLabel@ => @label@

This rules apply to all Swing classes available in the JDK. There are a few additional nodes that provide a special function, which will be explained next.
