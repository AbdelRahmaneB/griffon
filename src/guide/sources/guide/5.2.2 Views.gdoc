Views are responsible for defining how the application looks like. View scripts are always executed in the context of an UberBuilder, which means that Views have access to all nodes, properties and methods contributed by builders configured in @Builder.groovy@.

Views can reference directly both the model and controller instances that belong directly to their own MVC group.
