This is a pass through node that accepts any UI component as value. As opposed to @container@, this node *does not* allow nesting of child content. It's quite useful when what you need is to embed a custom component for which a node is not available, for example

{code}
widget(new MyCustomDisplay(), title: 'Groovy') {
{code}
