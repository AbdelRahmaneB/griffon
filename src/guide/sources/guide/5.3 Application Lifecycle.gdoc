Every Griffon application goes through the same life cycle phases no matter in which mode they are running, with the exception of applet mode where there is an additional phase due to the intrinsic nature of applets. The application's lifecycle has been inspired by JSR-296, the Swing Application Framework.

Every phase has an associated life cycle script that will be invoked at the appropriate time. These scripts are guaranteed to be invoked inside the UI thread (the Event Dispatch Thread in Swing). The script names match each phase name; you'll find them inside @griffon-app/lifecycle@.
