h1. factories

h2. Purpose

Provide additional node factories.

h2. Examples

bc.
class SampleGriffonAddon {
    def factories = [
        customComponent: new MyCustomComponentFactory()
    ]
}

h2. Description

The @factories@ property is responsible for adding new node factories to builders. Each node factory is defined by a key (matching the node name) and a Factory instance. However if the value is not a factory but a Class it will then be wrapped with a simple BeanFactory.
