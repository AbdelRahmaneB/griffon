    <a href="http://griffon-framework.org">Griffon</a> is desktop application
    development platform for the JVM.
</p>

<p>
    Inspired by <a href="http://grails.org">Grails</a>, Griffon leverages the
    use of the <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org">Groovy</a> language and
    concepts like Convention over Configuration. The Swing toolkit is the
    default UI toolkit of choice however others may be used, for example JavaFX.
</p>

<p>
    Griffon encourages the use of the MVC pattern. Griffon also follows in the
    spirit of the Swing Application Framework (JSR 296), it defines a simple yet
    powerful application life cycle and event publishing mechanism. Another
    interesting feature comes from the Groovy language itself: automatic
    property support and property binding (inspired by BeansBinding (JSR 295)),
    which makes creating observable beans and binding to their properties a
    snap! As if property binding was not enough Groovy's SwingBuilder also
    simplifies building multi-threaded applications, say goodbye to the ugly
    gray rectangle (the bane of Swing apps)!
</p>

<p>
    Grails developers should feel right at home when trying out Griffon. Many of
    Grails' conventions and commands are shared with Griffon. Granted, Swing is
    not the same as HTML/GSP but Builders simplify the task of creating the UI.
</p>

<p>
    Seasoned Java developers will also be able to pick up the pace quickly, as
    the framework relieves you of the burden of maintaining an application
    structure, allowing you to concentrate on getting the code right.
