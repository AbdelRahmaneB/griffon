*By Andres Almiray, Danno Ferrin, and James Shingler* +
_Foreword by Dierk Koenig_

_Griffon in Action_ is a comprehensive tutorial written for Java developers who want a more productive
approach to UI development. After a quick Groovy tutorial, you'll immediately dive into Griffon and
start building examples that explore its high productivity approach to Swing development.
Source code can be found https://github.com/aalmiray/griffoninaction[here].

****
The book discusses Griffon 1.x, which is largely compatible with Griffon 2.x in terms
of behavior but some things have changed since, chiefly:

[square]
* There is no longer a +griffon+ command. Gradle or Maven are used instead.
* https://github.com/pledbrook/lazybones[Lazybones] is required to create a project, instead of archetypes.
* Plugins are regular JAR files.
* Groovy is no longer the default language of choice.
