== Griffon 2.4.0 Release Notes

=== Dependencies

The following dependencies have been upgraded

 * org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all:2.4.4

=== Runtime

==== Java8 Support

There is a new `griffon-core-java8` module that delivers Java8 specific support. The first iteration of this module provides
specialized ``PropertyEditor``s for `java.time.LocalDate`, `java.time.LocalDateTime` and `java.time.LocalTime`.

==== Chained PropertyEditors

It's now possible to chain several ``PropertyEditor``s that target the same source class. You must make use of
`PropertyEditorResolver.registerEditor` and `PropertyEditorResolver.findEditor` instead of the JDK's `PropertyEditorManager`.

==== MVCGroup Relationships

An `MVCGroup` can now supply the names of its children groups. When a parent `MVCGroup` is destroyed so will its children,
automatically. All references to `parent*` members on a child artifact will be set to `null` upon the group's destruction.

==== Resources, Messages and Configuration

It's now possible to decorate instances of `ResourceResolver`, `MessageSource` and `Configuration` using a decorator for
the respective type. The `griffon-groovy` package for example, adds the capability to resolve simple messages and resources
using Groovy's property syntax. Thus the following lines are equivalent

[source,groovy]
----
application.messageSource.getMessage('some.key') == application.messageSource['some.key']
application.resourceResolver.resolveResource('some.key') == application.resourceResolver['some.key']
----

==== JavaFX Support

There are a couple of improvements in `JavaFXUtils`:

 * The methods `findElement` and `findNode` work with more containers.
 * Actions can be bound to `ToolBar` buttons.

Also, the `GraphicPropertyEditor` can handle plain resources, such as `images/icon.png`, instead of an icon class argument
as before. Additional property editors include `LinearGradientPropertyEditor`, `RadialGradientPropertyEditor` and `PaintPropertyEditor`.

=== Buildtime

==== AST Transformations

JavaFX support adds two new AST transformations: `@ListChangeListener` and `@MapChangeListener`. They enable the registration
of `ListChangeListener` and `MapChangeListener` on JavaFX properties, much in the same way as `@PropertyListener` works
with `PropertyChangeListener` and `PropertyChangeEvent`.

All listeners generated by `@ChangeListener`, `@InvalidationListener`, `@ListChangeListener` and `@MapChangeListener` can be
 automatically wrapped with their Weak reference counterparts if the value of the `weak` annotation member is set to `true`.

==== Swing GDSL

For those developers that rely on IntelliJ IDEA, there's a new GDSL file that can autocomplete all nodes delivered by
SwingBuilder.

=== Compatibility

 * The method `containsKey` in `griffon.core.Context` returns `true` if the key exists in the current context or its hierarchy.
 * The method `hasKey` in `griffon.core.Context` returns `true` if the key exists in the current context only.
