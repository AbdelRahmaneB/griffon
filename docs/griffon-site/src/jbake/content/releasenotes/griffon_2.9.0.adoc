== Griffon 2.9.0 Release Notes

=== Dependencies

=== Runtime

==== JavaFX Support

`JavaFXAction` supports four new properties:

 * `style`: used to set style on the bound widget.
 * `graphic`: used to set the graphic node on the bound widget.
 * `graphicStyle`: used to set style on the graphic node of the bound widget.
 * `graphicStyleClass`: used to set style classes on the graphic node of the bound widget.

You may define a `&` at rhe beginning of the value of either `style` or `graphicStyle` properties,
this instructs the runtime to append the style definition instead of overwriting it.
